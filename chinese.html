    <h2>The story</h2>

    <p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
        That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
        They said, <q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
        The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe </strong>.</q>
        The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
        The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>
    </p>

    <p> The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
        The neighbors then said,<q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded,<q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>
        The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
        Again all the neighbors came around and said,<q class="villager">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,<q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>
    </p>

    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
        and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">good </strong> or <strong class="bad">bad </strong> —
        because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p><strong class="good"> Good </strong>
    and
    <strong class="bad"> Bad </strong>

    are just one perspective.</p>
